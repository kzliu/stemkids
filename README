Necessary Node Modules
======================
They are listed in the package.json:
    "any-db": "^2.1.0",
    "any-db-sqlite3": "^2.1.4",
    "basic-auth": "^1.0.3",
    "basicauth-middleware": "^1.1.0",
    "body-parser": "^1.15.0",
    "consolidate": "^0.14.0",
    "express": "^4.13.4",
    "hogan": "^1.0.2",
    "semantic": "0.0.1",
    "socket.io": "^1.4.5",
    "sqlite3": "^3.1.3"

Running the web app
===================
Our project is hosted on Heroku at the following url: https://stemkidslms.herokuapp.com/

It can also be run from the command line using: node server.js
This starts the server so a user can navigate to localhost:1234 and explore our project!

For detailed information about current implementation and future functionality, please see the stemkidsLMSmanual in this directory.


Project Design:
===============
All necessary front end elements regarding this project can be found in the updated_html folder. Most if not all javascript front end elements are located in their respective html files. The two major elements relating to backend functionality are the server, which handles backend/frontend interaction, and the loader file which maintains the database schema. The admin page can be accessed from the applicant home page and is protected by basic authentication middleware with a set username, password combination that can be changed on the server.


Known Bugs:
===========
There are a few known minor bugs with the program. Due to the current method in which we are handling user information some of the pages rendered by a user who is not logged in may render incorrectly (this, of course, does not diminish program functionality). Also, for an unknown reason, the prompt for a username and password while attempting to access the admin page only appears once before rendering the page. There is also a minor issue when running the program on Safari. The issues with Safari appear to browser specific and we are currently unaware of any potential solutions.


Server Issues:
==============
The program has been deployed on Heroku which has a minor issue of sleeping after 30 minutes of inactivity and must sleep for 6 hours in a 24-hour-period.
When someone accesses the app, the server will automatically wake up to run the web process type. This causes a short delay for this first request, but subsequent requests perform normally.

Aspects that can be Improved:
=============================
Due to a lack of time, we were unable to finish the update course methods.


Project Usage:
==============
At the moment, all one needs to do to run the program is to run the server using the command "node server.js" and go to the respective local host in a browser.
